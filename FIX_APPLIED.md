# ✅ FIX APPLIED - 404 Error Resolved

## 🐛 Problem Identified
The dashboard was trying to access: `http://localhost/tank/api/get_tank_data.php`
But the actual path is: `http://localhost/Tank/tank/api/get_tank_data.php` (capital T)

## ✅ Solution Applied
Changed the API path in `config.js` to use **relative path** instead of absolute URL.

**File Changed**: `tank/dashboard/js/config.js` (Line 11)

**Before:**
```javascript
API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost/tank/api',
```

**After:**
```javascript
API_BASE_URL: '../api',
```

## 🎯 Why This Works
Using relative path (`../api`) means:
- From dashboard folder: `tank/dashboard/`
- Go up one level: `tank/`
- Then into api: `tank/api/`
- Works regardless of server URL or folder capitalization

## 🚀 What To Do Now

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
Or: Ctrl + F5 (hard refresh)
```

### 2. Refresh Dashboard
```
http://localhost/tank/dashboard/
```

### 3. Check Console (F12)
You should now see:
```
✅ Data fetched successfully
✅ Dashboard initialized successfully!
```

## 📊 What Should Work Now

- ✅ Tank visualization updates with real data
- ✅ Metric cards show current levels
- ✅ Chart displays historical data
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- ✅ All features functional
- ✅ No more 404 errors

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### Test the API directly:
Open in browser:
```
http://localhost/Tank/tank/api/get_tank_data.php?tank_id=1
```

You should see JSON data with tank information.

### Check Dashboard Console:
Press F12, you should see:
```
🚀 Tank Monitoring Dashboard
📍 Environment: LOCAL
🔗 API Base URL: ../api
⏱️  Refresh Interval: 5s
[Tank Monitor] Data fetched successfully
```

## 🚀 For Production Deployment

When you deploy to iotlogic.in, the relative path will still work!

No changes needed because:
- `../api` will resolve to `https://iotlogic.in/tank/api`
- Works automatically with the production environment

## 🎊 Status: FIXED!

The dashboard should now be fully functional. Refresh your browser and enjoy!

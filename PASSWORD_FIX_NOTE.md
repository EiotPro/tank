# 🔐 AP Password Fixed - Now 8 Digits!

## ❌ Problem Identified
Your phone was rejecting the 4-digit password "1234" because:
- **Modern phones require WiFi passwords to be at least 8 characters**
- This is a WPA2 security requirement
- 4-digit passwords don't meet the minimum length standard

## ✅ Solution Applied
Changed AP password from **4 digits to 8 digits**:
- **Old password**: `1234` ❌ (Too short)
- **New password**: `12345678` ✅ (8 digits, meets requirement)

## 🎯 What Changed
**File**: `include/wifi_manager.h` (Line 701)

**Before**:
```cpp
ap_password = "1234";  // Simple 4-digit PIN for security
```

**After**:
```cpp
ap_password = "12345678";  // 8-digit PIN (required by most phones)
```

## 📱 How to Connect Now

### Step 1: Connect to WiFi
```
Network Name: TankMonitor-XXXX  (XXXX = last 4 hex digits of MAC)
Password:     12345678
```

### Step 2: Access Portal
The captive portal should open automatically, or go to:
```
http://192.168.4.1
```

### Step 3: Configure
- See live tank data dashboard
- Scan and select your WiFi network
- Enter WiFi password
- Configure advanced settings
- Save and connect!

## 🔧 Password Requirements Explained

### Why 8 Characters Minimum?
**WPA2 Security Standard**:
- Minimum: 8 characters
- Maximum: 63 characters
- Can be: letters, numbers, symbols

### Phone Behavior:
- **iPhone/iOS**: Won't accept < 8 characters
- **Android**: Won't accept < 8 characters  
- **Windows**: May accept but shows warning
- **macOS**: Won't accept < 8 characters

### Why This Matters:
Your phone's OS **enforces** this requirement to protect users from weak passwords. Even though we control the AP, the phone doesn't know that and applies security rules.

## ✨ Benefits of 8-Digit Password

- ✅ Simple sequence: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8

### WiFi AP Configuration:
```cpp
// AP Settings
SSID:     TankMonitor-XXXX  (dynamic based on MAC)
Password: 12345678           (8-digit PIN)
IP:       192.168.4.1

(That's the digits 1 through 8)
```

#### 3. Restart Device

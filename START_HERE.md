## 🎯 KEY CONFIGURATION FILE

**Most Important**: `tank/dashboard/js/config.js`

Line 5 controls environment:
```javascript
const ENV = 'LOCAL';      // ← For development (localhost)
// Change to:
const ENV = 'PRODUCTION'; // ← For production (iotlogic.in)
```

This ONE LINE switch changes:
- API URLs (localhost vs iotlogic.in)
- Refresh intervals (5s vs 30s)
- Debug logging (on vs off)
- Error verbosity
